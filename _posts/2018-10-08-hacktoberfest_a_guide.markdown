During the month of October, Digital Ocean hosts an even called “Hacktoberfest” to promote open source collaboration. This year marks the fifth year that the event has been hosted and the second year that I’ve participated in the challenge.

### The How

To participate in the event, interested participants must enroll by authorizing Digital Ocean to access data from their GitHub. Hacktoberfest participants are asked to make five contributions to open source software or projects. Each pull request made counts towards your eligibility for a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt—*and who doesn’t like a free T-shirt?*

### The What

So, what exactly is “open source” software you might ask? Open source refers to projects or software that are open for modification, meaning the code is publicly available and can be contributed to, edited, or used by anyone. 

And, “pull requests”? Pull requests are a way for you to alert someone on GitHub that you’ve made changes to their project folder, or repository. By making a pull request, you are essentially requesting that the changes you’ve made, to whatever you’ve made them on, be accepted—it is up to the repository’s collaborators to then accept or reject your pull requests. It is not uncommon for a repository to have its own style guide, so be sure to keep that in mind before submitting a pull request. 

### The Why

I participated in Hacktoberfest for the first-time last year. I had just started to program and came across an article on Medium about the event. While at the time I didn’t fully understand what it meant to make pull requests or contribute to open source software, I did understand the importance of branching out of my comfort zone and trying something new.

There are many options when it comes to choosing what to contribute to it, and the decision can be daunting. I found that contributing to freecodecamp’s programming guide was both easy and educational. While it is fun, Hacktoberfest is all about collaboration and learning. Participating in the event not only helped build up my GitHub, but also helped build my coding confidence. 

### Hacktoberfest Integration with Learn.co

Participating in Hacktoberfest as a Flatiron School student has its perks. Learn.co’s integration with GitHub allows for quite the contribution boost during Hacktoberfest. Pull requests made during the program ultimately count towards your Hacktoberfest pull request bottom line. While this integration is convenient and will quickly get you a limited edition T-shirt, the purpose of Hacktoberfest is to get participants to work with others to contribute to open source—I would still advise taking advantage of all of the other wonderful open source software available on top of Learn.co’s open source software. The more pull requests you make, the more you’ll grow as a programmer and contribute to the growth of a program—how sweet?
