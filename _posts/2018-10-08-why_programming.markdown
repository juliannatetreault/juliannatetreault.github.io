Languages have always intrigued me. As a child, I would often think about how languages came to be—how were they created, why were certain words what they were, the interactions between words and how that created meaning. This curiosity has never faded. While eight-year-old me would be floored by what I know now, I am still learning. 

The first time I tinkered with a computer was during fifth-grade. A family member of mine who worked as an engineer had brought home a clunky desktop computer. My sister and I watched as he took it apart, piece-by-piece, and listened while he explained what each part was—I was enthralled. And while I have always been surrounded by technology, it wasn’t until recently that I was able to articulate my love for programming.

A year ago, when I was posed with the question, *“have you heard of a Raspberry Pi?”*, my curiosity was rekindled. I would have never guessed that what seemed to be such an innocuous question asked during an otherwise typical social interaction would completely shake the foundation of my life. 

The answer to question was simple—no, I did not know what a Raspberry Pi was, but I was sure as hell going to find out. I very quickly realized that reading articles and downloading a litany of Raspberry Pi books wasn’t going to suffice. I needed to know more. The curious child in me resurfaced like she tends to do. 

A relatively quick Google search did the trick. I needed to learn how to program to understand these mysterious Pis. One thing led to another, and I soon began following online programming tutorials. This quest for knowledge went on for hours, days, weeks, and I eventually stumbled upon Flatiron School. 

What began as a programming trial period, ended as a long-term educational endeavor. Working through Flatiron School’s bootcamp preparation ultimately led me to enrolling in their Online Software Engineering course. 

Where science and creativity meet, I found passion. My choice to pursue software wasn’t difficult to make, and while I haven’t tackled programming a Raspberry Pi yet, I’m sure that I will get to it in no time. This is just the beginning of a lifetime filled with learning.
