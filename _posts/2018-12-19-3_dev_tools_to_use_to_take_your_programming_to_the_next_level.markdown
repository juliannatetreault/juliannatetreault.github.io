Whether you’re learning how to program, or you’re already an established developer, you can never have enough developer tools in your tool box. Below are three of my favorite developer tools that have taken my programming to the next level.

### Dash Docs

DashDocs is a developer’s best friend—it is an app that allows you to look at official API documentation, as well as code snippets on and offline. One of DashDocs’ best features is the fact that it allows its users to download its content for offline learning. Not only is DashDocs absolutely loaded with information, but it is simple and easy to use. DashDocs has quickly become one of my favorite developer tools.

### MedleyText

Taking notes as a developer can be tedious. Not many apps have the ability to save code snippets, especially in various languages, and the ones that do, don’t always have the best functionality. This is where MedleyText comes in. MedleyText is an application that allows developers to easily and seamlessly take notes—from notes for the software class you’re currently enrolled in, or code snippets from a friend’s project, MedleyText is able to support the notetaking dev’s needs. I’ve found MedleyText particularly helpful while going through Flatiron’s Software Engineering Bootcamp. Through MedleyText, I have been able to take detailed notes on my code—this has led to better studying sessions, and has allowed me to find my old notes with ease. I highly suggest that all Flatiron students try using MedleyText.

### Pomodoro Timer 

Otherwise known as a “tomato timer,” Pomodoro Timers are a great tool to use when you need to get into your programming zone. What sets this timer aside from others is its unique concept—the Pomodoro Timer is used to create goals, make habits, and to get users into a working flow. The Pomodoro Timer works in intervals, where you work for 25 minutes at a time, with five-minute breaks in between. After you have completed four full cycles (25 minutes taking a five-minute break in between), you are rewarded a long break. The long breaks last for 15 minutes, giving you just enough time to relax, but not enough time to break out of your working zone. For new developers, or seasoned developers struggling to get in their zone, the Pomodoro Timer can be a huge help.
