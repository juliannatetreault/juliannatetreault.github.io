The interview process can be daunting, but there are ways that you can prepare for it to make you a more confident candidate. While there is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to interviews, there are tips and tactics to get you through whatever may be thrown your way. In this post, I will share with you some thoughtful questions that have worked incredibly well for me during interviews.

There is truth in the claim that *the questions that you ask your interviewer are just as important as the questions they ask you*. Now, take a moment and let that sink in. 

That statement may very well frighten you—don’t let it get to you. Rather than fretting about yet another aspect of the interview process, take a deep breath and rejoice, as below is an almost fail-proof set of questions you can pull from when push comes to shove. So, without further ado, some of my favorite, thoughtful interview questions are as follows:

1.	“I have a few questions for you, but before I get into those I wanted to ensure that I’ve answered all of yours—Is there anything you’d like me to elaborate on?”

*This question is a great segue into whatever questions you’re itching to ask your interviewer. Starting your questions off with this shows the interviewer that while you are excited to listen to their responses, you care enough to double-check that they have finished gathering whatever information they need from you first.*


2.	“What do most new hires in this role struggle with?”
3.	“What have past employees done to succeed in this position?”
4.	“What brought you to this company and what do you like most about working here?”
5.	“What does a typical work day to look like for someone in this position?”
6.	“What does your onboarding process look like and are there any opportunities for mentorship for new hires?”
7.	“What metrics gauge success?”
8.	“I see that your company uses ~insert language/stack they use here~. Why was this language/stack chosen over others? What advantages/disadvantages does using this language pose for your company?”
9.	“I’m very interested in ~insert thing you are interested in here~ --could you elaborate more on that, please?” 


*If you feel that the interview went well, the following questions are great to ask and gauge what the interview process will look like going forward*: 

10.	“Going forward, what can I expect the next hiring process steps to look like?”
11.	“Is there anything you need from me to move the process along?”
12.	“Is there anything we haven’t covered that you think is important to know about working here?”

The key to pulling these questions off is to use them when the timing is right. Rather than rehearsing, naturally sprinkling these questions throughout the Q&A session and beyond works really, really well. While they will not guarantee you a job, they should generate some *oooooo*’s and *aaahhhh*’s from your interviewer and help you stand out amongst other candidates.
