Sending a post-interview thank you note is arguably one of the most important things you can do to be a stand-out candidate during your job search. Now, the trick to really wowing recruiters or potential coworkers lies in the way you craft your email—each email should be unique to the person you spoke with and topics you covered during your conversation. This isn’t to say that you can’t stub out a template to use for each thank you email – the goal is to work *smarter*, not *harder* – it’s just a way to approach sending those ever-important thank yous. 

So, you may be thinking, *“when exactly do I have to send a thank you email?”* —the golden correspondence rule that I follow is to send thank you emails within 24 hours of your conversation. Of course, there is no harm in sending the email earlier than later, but generally speaking, sending the note within 24 hours of when you spoke is a good standard to adopt.

Now that we’ve gotten the important who, what, where, when, and whys out of the way, let’s get down to the specifics—what to include in the email. Below is a template that I stubbed out for myself and use for thank you emails that I send. While the bulk of the information that I include in the email changes with each note that I send, the structure typically remains the same.

Subject: Thank You **[** make a custom subject line for each thank you that you send—if you spoke over the phone, you can make the subject something along the lines of “Phone Interview Follow Up: Thank You” **]**

Hey **[** person you spoke with **]**, 

It was a pleasure meeting with you **[** yesterday or today depending on when you send your email **]** to discuss my interest in working with the **[** name of company you spoke with **]** team! Thank you for taking the time out of your **[** time of day **]** to discuss **[** logistics, job requirements, or whatever it is that you centered your conversation around **]** and to clarify any outstanding questions I had—hearing about the company’s **[** culture, values, application, or whatever you were truly thrilled to hear about **]** was truly **[** adjective **]**.

I really enjoyed being able to walk you through my **[** Flatiron, previous schooling, or previous work **]** experience—the prospect of being able to leverage my **[** programming language, stack, or industry knowledge **]** knowledge into something useful for **[** name of company you spoke with **]** is **[** adjective or descriptor for how you feel **]**. **[** Insert something you learned and explain how you’ll move forward with this information or how you’ll leverage it into the interview process/position **]**.

On a final note, **[** include any further information or attachments they asked for during the meeting here, or recap what it is you’ll be doing to move forward with the process—if they asked you to complete a task, mention it: “As we discussed towards the end of our conversation, I will…” **]**. 

Thank you again for your time. I am looking forward to speaking with you **[** in the near future, next week, or whenever you will speak with them next **]**!

Best, 

**[** First and Last name **]**
