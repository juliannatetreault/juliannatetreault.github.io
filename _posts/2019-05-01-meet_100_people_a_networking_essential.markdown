### The Book

Networking can be intimidating and as a recent graduate, I felt unfamiliar with the practice. While there is an infinite amount of resources available to help you hone in on the skill, it wasn’t until I was introduced to Pat Hedley’s book, *Meet 100 People: A How-To Guide To The Career And Life Edge Everyone Is Missing*, that I felt more confident networking than ever.

The book itself is a brief read, coming in at only 157 pages on my Kindle—I was able to read the book cover-to-cover in just a matter of hours. Don’t let the size of the book fool you though, *Meet 100 People* is a trove of post-graduation and networking advice. With only ten chapters and three parts, Pat Hedley does a great job of breaking the book down into concise chunks of need-to-know information.

### Takeaways 

I highly recommend that anyone looking to network efficiently read *Meet 100 People*, as there is no substitute for actually reading the book. But, for those of you who still aren’t sold on the book, here are some of its key takeaways:

* **Networking can be learned.**
* While networking can be done in many ways, there is no substitute for meeting people face-to-face. **Networking with people in-person is crucial.** 
* Laying out what your **values**, **goals** and **objectives** are creates a roadmap for which you can follow throughout networking and life—**self-reflection plays a key role in becoming an effective networker.**
* **Pre-networking preparation is crucial.** Do not skimp on looking into the person you’re meeting with or the company that they work at. Brief research is the least you can do.
* Ultimately, **the goal of networking is to establish a genuine connection** with the person.
* **Always follow up** with the people you’ve met—sending a post-networking thank you email is just as important as networking itself. **Be proactive.**
* Do not be afraid to ask—**you if you don’t ask, you’ll never receive**.
* **Be genuine.** Being yourself is crucial to establishing connections.
* **Leverage your existing network.** Everyone starts with a base network – family, friends, co-workers – that plays an essential role in meeting other people. 
* **Nix any self-defeating thoughts** you may have about networking.
