Technical interviews are practically impossible to escape in the tech world—they’re an essential part of getting admitted to a coding bootcamp and landing a technical job. A technical interview is essentially just that, an interview that assesses one’s technical skills. While technical interviews vary from place-to-place, you’ll tend to find that many are similar—it is not uncommon to be given a take-home coding challenge or to have to walk through some code. If you haven’t had the pleasure of partaking in a technical interview just yet, but fully intend on immersing yourself in a technical field, now is your time to prep! This post is written for those looking for some interview guidance. Whether you’re gearing up for a technical now, or you’ve already completed one round interviews, you can never do too much preparation!
 
### Preparation 

While technical interviews differ depending on the position and place you’re interviewing for, there are a few standard concepts that are good to go into an interview knowing. It is never a bad idea to study algorithms and data structures—more often than not, you will be asked to write or walk through one or both of the concepts. To prepare for the two, looking to resources such as Code Wars, HackerRank, or *Cracking The Coding Interview* are helpful. For technical interviews that involve pair programming, the best preparation you can do going into the interview is pair program—find someone that you can practice programming and walking through code with. As for whiteboarding, getting a whiteboard and practicing writing and walking through your code just as you would in the actual interview is crucial—writing code in your text editor and writing code on a whiteboard can feel like two very different things. Finally, I always encourage people to look up the bootcamp or company they’re applying for to see if they can find anything on their technical interviews online—knowing what to expect can make you a calmer and better prepared candidate when it comes time to code.

### Mentality

Prior to a technical interview, mentality can be everything. Speaking to yourself in a positive and uplifting way can set the tone for the entire interview. Mental preparation is often overlooked, but can make or break you when the pressure is on—go into the interview with a bright outlook.

### Breathing Techniques 

If the going gets tough and you’re feeling overwhelmed in during your technical, taking a deep breath can make all the difference. Technical interviews can certainly be nerve-racking and it is absolutely normal to feel anxious. That being said, taking a minute to breathe before, during (if need be), and after an interview can be beneficial. One of the techniques that I’ve found to be really useful is to practice square breathing. Square breathing is a breathing pattern that involves inhaling for 4 seconds, holding the inhale for 4 seconds, exhaling for 4 seconds, and then holding the exhale for 4 seconds. The technique helps slow your breathing down and center you—if you need to get yourself in the right headspace, this technique can be super helpful.

### Conclusion

Surviving a technical interview can feel like a large feat, but with some practice and a positive attitude, performing well during a technical can be easier than you think. Instead of spending time worrying about the interview, spend your time preparing for it.
